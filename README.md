# Occupancy
2015-2016 senior design. 

Occupancy is a system of sensors that can be spread across a building and be analyzed, in our case we are designing it for a college library. These sensory units will be used in order to establish the number of people in each area, and the amount of time they spend in each area. This information can then be used in order to make the library more convenient for students.
